# BLOGIFY API ðŸ“‘âœ¨

Welcome to Blogify, where words come to life and stories find their digital home! __Blogify__ is more than just a blog app; it's a vibrant community of passionate writers, storytellers, and readers coming together to share, explore, and engage in the art of blogging.

## Overview

This repository contains essential information and guidelines for understanding and contributing to our project. Please read through this README to familiarize yourself with our Definitions Of Done (DoD) and find links to our frontend and backend repositories.

## Definitions Of Done (DoD)

The Definitions Of Done (DoD) for our project are aligned with the professor's requirements:

1. **Authentication & Authorization System:**
   - a) Visitors can access the blog without authentication.
   - b) Users must be logged in to publish an article.

2. **Data Collection:**
   - Implement a robust system for collecting and managing data.

3. **Recommendation System:**
   - Develop a recommendation system to enhance the user experience.

### AI Features

The AI feature enhances user experience by providing personalized topic suggestions. Here's how it works:

- Only authenticated users have access to the AI feature.
- The AI suggests topics based on two criteria:
  1. **Personal Preferences:** This aspect is tailored to the individual user, considering their posts, visited posts, and the categories of topics they've chosen during their subscription.
  2. **Community Preferences:** This aspect considers the overall community's preferences, analyzing existing categories, as well as the engagement metrics like likes and dislikes on posts.

### About the App

Uses the [Java](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-java-windows) [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/) framework and [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) with [POJA](https://github.com/hei-school/poja-cli).
